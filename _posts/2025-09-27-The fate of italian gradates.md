title: "The fate of italian graduates"
summary: "An analysis of employment rates and earnings of italian garduates across different fields."

A country’s prime asset is its talent—the bright, capable people who drive innovation and productivity. Today, that mostly requires deep specialisation in technical fields and an industrial fabric able to absorb those skills and remunerate them fairly. Building such a workforce doesn’t happen spontaneously; it depends on well-structured policies for secondary and tertiary education and credible industrial planning. Italy struggles on both counts, and the gravity of these failures is evident in two indicators for recent graduates: **employment rates** and **salaries**. \ 
In this post I examine, through the numbers, the troubling outcomes facing Italy’s early-career cohorts on two these two metrics. First, I map the distribution of results across fields of study; then I compare Italy’s performance with other OECD countries.
